# Prove It Works

Runtime: written for Cursor, running in bb. A pstack skill a step routes to is part of that step: read `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in full before doing it. A subagent a step names is part of it too, however small the question: a second model chosen in `models.md` does or checks that work, so launch it as a bb child thread per `.claude/skills/poteto-mode/references/bb-runtime.md` and finish the step with its output. That file also maps questions, loops and transcripts.

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

Check the real thing, not a proxy:
- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

## Script the check when you can

The strongest proof is a deterministic script that re-runs the same comparison, not a one-time eyeball. Write the script, run it, and keep its output as an artifact a reviewer can re-run instead of trusting your word.

Keep the artifact visible for the human. Commit it only for large or complex work where the trail has to be auditable later, like a big port or migration (the **show-me-your-work** skill).
